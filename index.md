Welcome to my GitHub page!

I am James Peters, a graduate student pursuing a Master's degree in I/O Psychology at North Carolina State University.

I am an aspiring I/O Psychology Practitioner interested in Personnel Selection specifically and People Analytics more generally.

In the short term, the topics I will blog about will be related to the topics covered in ST 558: Data Science for Statisticians. In the medium to long term, I plan to blog about topics related to my career interests in I/O Psychology. This will include topics related to Personnel Selection, Job Analysis, Competency Modeling, and Workforce Planning to name a few.

Beyond academics and research, I enjoy bicycling, playing board and card games, and spending time with my wife, Kaitlyn.
