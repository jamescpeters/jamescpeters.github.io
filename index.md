Welcome to my GitHub page!

My name is James Peters, and I am a graduate student pursuing a Master's degree in I/O Psychology at North Carolina State University.

I am an aspiring I/O Psychology Practitioner who is interested in Personnel Selection specifically and People Analytics more generally.

In the short term, the topics I will blog about will be related to the topics covered in ST 558: Data Science for Statisticians. In the medium to long term, I plan to blog about topics related to my career interests in I/O Psychology. This will include topics related to Personnel Selection, Job (or Work) Analysis, Competency Modeling, and Workforce Planning to name a few.
